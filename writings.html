       <h1 class="py-4 font-italic font-weight-light>">The only <span class="font-weight-bold">four reasons</span> to invest in business technology</h1>
       <p class="lead my-3 font-italic">There are four, clear and simple reasons any technology is required in business.  If you stand back and evaluate all investments in one of these five categories, your strategy becomes abundantly more clear.</p>
       <p class="blog-post-meta">September 30, 2018 by <a href="#">Michael Daniels</a></p>
       <p>Can it be this basic?  Four reasons?  <span class="font-weight-bold">Compliance, Automation, Analysis,</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">Revenue</span> - in our estimation, everything falls into one of these four simple categories.</p>
       <p>Compliance is the foundational reason why any business use information technology.  This is the strongest reason. Every organization has some level of governmental oversight that requires they show clear compliance with any regulations.  Violations have the implication of operating penalties, fines that may be levied, and in some situations, criminal cases could be brought forward on executives.  Well designed technology solutions will ensure clear audit trails that illustrate compliance with the regulations.</p>
       <p>Automation is where much of the investment in technology has existed over the past 50 years.  The business world over that period time has been laser focused on the topics of streamlining, speed and scale.  Reducing labor costs has been the easiest target to improve profits and information technology assists in enabling this strategy.  The span of IT automation includes moving critical data from one business operation to another, the calculation of difficult math, the execution of business decisions that fall into acceptable tolerances, and the notification of important events that have or will happen to resources in the business. Frankly this is an incredibly small sliver of how information technology automates in business.</p>
        <p>What everyone business must consider is what is the goal of automation and does it yield short or long term cost improvements.  Does it provide competitive advantage.  The easiest illustration of when to consider automation is when their is significant continued growth.  Well placed automation will avoid the need to hire more resources to support a labor intensive task.  That is, if the task can be reasonably automated.  Conversely, a company may be stagnated or in a stagnated industry.  In this case, automation could be required to remain market competitive.  The final reason that automation may be considered in business is simply to prepare the company be sold.  A companyâ€™s ability to demonstrate easily repeatable business processes that employees new to the company can pick up makes the company itself a more valuable asset.</p>
