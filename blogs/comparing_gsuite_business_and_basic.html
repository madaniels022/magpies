</div>

<div class="container">
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light py-3">As a small to medium-sized business leader, are you struggling to choose which Google G Suite subscription is best for your organization?  Specifically, are you trying to determine why you should select the more feature-rich G Suite Business over the less costly version G Suite Basic?  Google provides clear guidance on the capabilities delivered in each edition, which can be found at this <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://gsuite.google.com/compare-editions/" target="blank">link</a>.  The goal of this article is to summarize the difference between each and help you determine which subscription is most appropriate for your business.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light py-3">Our team at Magpies Consulting has determined there are seven enhanced capabilities the Business option provides that are not available in the Basic option.  Depending on your organization, these features may be critical to your success.  We describe each below in terms of how they would be used and the impact they may have on your organization.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic py-2">1. Collaboration on documents both within and outside the organization.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light py-3">Does your organization share and collaborate on documents?  For instance, does HR need a central location to store applicant resumes and provide easy access for the staff. Additionally, a team working on a project may want a common repository where they can collaborate on documents.  Externally, you may want to work together on documents with customers, partners, or suppliers.  In this instance, it may be sharing a project plan, allowing everyone to quickly review and update the status of activities.</h5>

  <div class="container">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image4.png" alt="Google Drive image.">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-wrap font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span>This feature, called <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025?hl=en&ref_topic=7337266" target="blank">Shared Drive</a>, is part of the Google Drive product.  The solution allows users, with the proper authorizations, to create document folders that can be shared with users inside and outside the organization.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> Using Shared Drives will help your teams work together more easily, ultimately getting tasks completed quickly and accurately. The additional ability to collaborate with people outside your company will also get things done faster.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic pb-3">2. The amount of space each user has to store files and emails.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">Does your organization need to store large quatities of documents and emails? Do you want to allow your employees to keep an unlimited amount of files and emails? Our experience is that very few of our clients require this amount of data storage, however, there are instances where this is needed.</h5>

  <div class="container">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image1.png" alt="Google Gmail image">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-4"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span>G Suite Business provides unlimited Drive and Gmail storage.  The Basic edition limits each user to 30 GB of Drive storage and 30 GB of Gmail storage.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> This extra storage space is either something your business operation just needs or a decision to provide your employees the convenience of not worrying about how much stuff to keep.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic pb-3">3. Retaining or removing documents and communications based on your needs.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">Does your organization required to produce historical communications or documents for regulatory compliance or for legal matters?  Do you want to be able to control the amount of information retained by your users?  Perhaps your organization would prefer that users retain no more than one year of historical email and no more than 30 days of chats.</h5>

  <div class="container-flex">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image3.png" alt="Google Vault image">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-wrap font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span> The product that provides these features is called <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2462365?hl=en&ref_topic=9197" target="blank">Vault</a>.  Described as a retention and eDiscovery tool, it has the ability to define data retention rules for both the entire organization as well as individuals.  Vault can also search, analyze and export the retained content.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> If you have any regulatory or legal compliance requirements, Vault will save an immense amount of time and ensure reporting accuracy. Additionally, it reduces information retained by by employees, ultimately simplifying their work life.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic pb-3">4. Enable users to easily find any content across the entire organization</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">What time could your employees save if they could easily find everything related to a specific topic?  As an illustration, they could enter a project name, such as "Acme", and everything with "Acme" that they have access to would show up.  This would include emails, calendar events, chats, and documents.</h5>

  <div class="container">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image5.png" alt="Google Cloud Search image">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-wrap font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span> The product that provides these features is called <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://support.google.com/a/topic/7167202?hl=en&ref_topic=9197" target="blank">Cloud Search</a>.  You can think of this as the same web search tool you know and love from Google, just focused on your organization’s content.  It is important to note that the solution uses your defined security parameters so users only see the content they have access to.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> The simple idea of Cloud Search is that it will reduce the time required to find information and helps employees improve their productivity.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic pb-3">5. Increased number of participants who can join a web-based meeting.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">Will your organization need to deliver web-based meetings to a large number of people?  The scenario may be that you want to hold a company-wide meeting to share important news with all of your employees.  Similarly, you may want to share product training or updates with your customers or partners.</h5>

  <div class="container">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image7.png" alt="Google Meet image">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-wrap font-weight-light pb-4"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span> G Suite Business provides up to 150 users to attend a Google <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7303980?hl=en&visit_id=637242115990133112-482776715&rd=1" target="blank">Meet</a> session.  The Basic edition limits the number of attendees to 100 users.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> This enhancement to Meet may be only a marginal improvement, but will be clear because you either need more than 100 attendees, or not.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic pb-3">6. Analyze massive quantities of data using a spreadsheet interface.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">Does your organization store incredibly large amounts of data?  Would you benefit from reviewing that data using a spreadsheet, allowing you to manipulate and chart that data?</h5>

  <div class="container">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image8.png" alt="Google Sheets image">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-wrap font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span> Google recently released the ability for Google <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9604541?hl=en" target="blank">Sheets</a> to connect to Google BigQuery data.  We stated above incredibly large amounts of data, which translates to up to 10 billion rows of data.  Yes, that is large.  Once the connection is created to the BigQuery data, your users can analyze that data in Sheets.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> Enables improved and expanded business decision-making through the analysis of large quantities of data.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal font-italic pb-3">7. Increased ability to monitor and manage security with advanced administration tools.</h5>
  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">The detailed business scenarios are harder to describe with this capability.  Consider this question.  Does the organization’s leadership team believe that a security breach would adversely impact the ability to operate?  Would there be impacts to revenue or customer retention?  Are there regulatory compliance requirements placed on the organization because of the type of business?</h5>

  <div class="container">
    <img class="img-fluid float-left pr-4 mb-3" src="/images/blog_050520/image2.png" alt="Google Admin image">
    <div class="container">
      <h5 class="text-wrap font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Capability - </span> Google provides a variety of more advanced tools for both monitoring security events as well as implementing security policies.  These are all delivered through the Google <a class="font-weight-normal" href="https://support.google.com/a/topic/2413312?hl=en&ref_topic=4388346" target="blank">Admin</a> solution. An illustration of one of these features is the ability to more closely monitor, through audit reports, and manage Google Drive.</h5>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3"><span class="font-weight-normal">Targeted Benefits -</span> Further protects against any disruptions to business operations.</h5>

  <h5 class="text-left font-weight-light pb-3">How these additional features align with each organization’s needs will vary.  There are clear benefits that can be gained through G Suite Business and those may justify the increased costs.  It's important to note that additional space for Drive can be added on a per user basis.  Additionally, Vault and Search can be added to G Suite Basic under a separate subscription.  However, the added costs to include the additional subscriptions may be more than simply upgrading your organization to the Business edition.</h5>
